      <p>We have developed two games to test the engine. You can do either (or both) of the following tutorials to learn in approximately an hour how to use EngAGe's tools. <p>

      <ul>
        <li>For the Geography game EUmouse: <a href="http://yaellechaudy.com/tutorial_eumouse/Tutorial_educators_EUmouse.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a></li>
        <li>For the Language game vocShoot: <a href="http://yaellechaudy.com/tutorial_vocshoot/Tutorial_educators_vocShoot.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Both tutorial have four parts:</p>

		<h4>Part 1: Get to know EngAGe’s interface</h4>
      <p><i>approx. 10 minutes</i></p>
      	<p> 
      		Learn the basics about the interface, how to manage your games and students. You will learn how to create a student account and how to give them access to the games.
     	</p>

		<h4>Part 2: Play the game</h4>
      <p><i>approx. 10 minutes</i></p>
      	<p>
      		Get acquainted with the games that are available to you. And all the functionalities they offer (badges, leaderboard...).

    <h4>Part 3: Visualise gameplay data </h4>
      <p><i>approx. 15 minutes</i></p>
      	<p>
      		Once you understand what the game is about, you can come back to the interface and see its learning analytics dashboard. There are plenty of charts available to you there so you can visualise your students' performance, see what mistakes they made, their score in the game, what badges they earned and plenty more. The dashboard even have an option for you to generate personalised reports for your students.

    <h4>Part 4: Modify the game </h4>
      <p><i>approx. 10 minutes</i></p>
      	<p>
      		From the charts you saw in part 3, you might decide on some changes that need to be made to the game. This last section will take you through the assessment editor of EngAGe. In there you will be able to change the scores, the way the students are assessed, the feedback triggered, the badges conditions and even decide on a different end of game.
